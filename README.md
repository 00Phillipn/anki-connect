# AnkiConnect #

The AnkiConnect plugin for [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) provides a
[RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) interface for creating flash cards from
external applications. When installed, AnkiConnect will run a minimal
[Ajax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) server on port 8765 when Anki is running; connecting clients,
such as the [Yomichan Extension for Chrome](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan-chrome-ext) can make use of the
exposed API extend Anki functionality.


## Installation ##

AnkiConnect can be downloaded from its [Anki shared addon page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) or enabled
through the [Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan) plugin if you have it installed. Once AnkiConnect is installed, you are all set; no
further configuration is required.
