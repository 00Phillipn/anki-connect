# AnkiConnect #

The AnkiConnect plugin for [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) exposes a
[RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API for creating flash cards from external
applications. When installed, AnkiConnect will host an [Ajax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) server
on port 8765 for as long as Anki is running; connecting clients, such as [Yomichan for
Chrome](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan-chrome) can make use of this interface to extend Anki functionality.


## Installation ##

AnkiConnect can be downloaded from its [Anki shared addon page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) or enabled
through the [Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan) plugin if you have it installed. Once AnkiConnect is installed it is ready
for use; no further configuration is required.
